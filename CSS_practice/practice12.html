    <p class="text">"As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me: this is exactly the place I've
        been looking for all my life. A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere. I'd always thought of it as a
        secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists. I close my eyes and take a breath, and
        wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."</p>
